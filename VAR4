# **Advanced Risk Management Techniques: EVT, CVaR, RiskMetrics, and GARCH**

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **1. Introduction to Advanced Risk Metrics**

In addition to Value at Risk (VaR), other advanced risk metrics and models are widely used in financial risk management. Some of these methods include:

- **Extreme Value Theory (EVT)**
- **Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)**
- **RiskMetrics**
- **Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH)**

Each of these approaches is used to model and quantify the risk associated with extreme events or to improve the accuracy of volatility predictions.

## ðŸ“Œ **2. Extreme Value Theory (EVT)**

**Extreme Value Theory (EVT)** focuses on modeling the **tail** of the distribution, particularly the extreme losses or gains, which are often the most significant in risk management. EVT is especially important when you are interested in **rare but extreme events** (such as market crashes).

### **EVT Methodology**

1. **Block Maxima Approach**: Divides data into blocks and considers only the maximum value in each block.
2. **Peak Over Threshold (POT)**: Considers data points exceeding a predefined threshold to estimate the tail distribution.

### **Application in VaR**

- EVT is particularly useful for estimating **extreme risk** that cannot be captured well with standard parametric models.
- EVT helps in estimating **tail VaR**, especially at high confidence levels like 99% or 99.9%.

### **Example: EVT-based VaR Calculation**

Suppose you have daily returns data for a stock, and you are interested in estimating the **99.5% quantile** using the EVT.

- **Threshold (u)**: Choose a threshold based on historical data.
- **Excess data**: Collect data points exceeding the threshold.
- **Fit the Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD)**: Fit the excess data to a GPD.

The formula for GPD is:

$$
F(x) = 1 - \left(1 + \frac{\xi x}{\sigma}\right)^{-\frac{1}{\xi}} \quad \text{for} \quad x > u
$$

Where:
- \( \xi \) is the shape parameter
- \( \sigma \) is the scale parameter
- \( u \) is the threshold

## ðŸ“Œ **3. Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)**

**Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)**, also known as **Expected Shortfall (ES)**, is a risk measure that calculates the **expected loss** given that the loss is beyond the **VaR threshold**.

### **CVaR vs VaR**

- **VaR** provides a threshold value at a specific confidence level (e.g., 95%).
- **CVaR** estimates the **average loss** if the loss exceeds the VaR threshold.

### **Mathematical Formulation**

For a given confidence level \( \alpha \), CVaR is calculated as:

$$
\text{CVaR}_\alpha = \frac{1}{1 - \alpha} \int_\alpha^1 \text{VaR}_p \, dp
$$

Where:
- \( \alpha \) is the confidence level
- \( \text{VaR}_p \) is the VaR at probability level \( p \)

### **Example: CVaR Calculation**

Suppose the **VaR at 95%** is \$30,000 for a portfolio. You want to calculate the CVaR at the same confidence level. If the loss distribution is **normal**, you would compute the average loss beyond the 95% quantile.

## ðŸ“Œ **4. RiskMetrics Model**

**RiskMetrics** is a risk management methodology developed by J.P. Morgan for estimating the **volatility** and **correlation** of financial assets. It is particularly useful for **forecasting volatility** over a short time horizon.

### **RiskMetrics Assumptions**

- **Volatility Clustering**: Volatility tends to be high in high-volatility periods and low in low-volatility periods.
- **Normal Distribution**: The daily returns are assumed to follow a normal distribution with mean zero and some volatility.
- **Exponential Smoothing**: Volatility is calculated using an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA).

### **RiskMetrics Formula**

The volatility estimate at time \( t \) is calculated as:

$$
\sigma_t^2 = \lambda \sigma_{t-1}^2 + (1-\lambda) r_t^2
$$

Where:
- \( \sigma_t^2 \) is the variance of returns at time \( t \)
- \( \lambda \) is the smoothing parameter (typically set to 0.94)
- \( r_t^2 \) is the squared return at time \( t \)

### **Example: RiskMetrics VaR Calculation**

Suppose you have a portfolio with an initial value of \$1,000,000 and you estimate **volatility** using RiskMetrics with \( \lambda = 0.94 \) and \( r_t^2 \) as daily squared returns. The VaR at 95% confidence is:

$$
\text{VaR} = \text{Portfolio Value} \times \sigma_t \times Z_{\alpha}
$$

Where \( Z_{\alpha} \) is the z-score for the confidence level \( \alpha \) (1.65 for 95% confidence).

---

## ðŸ“Œ **5. Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH)**

The **GARCH model** is a class of statistical models used to estimate the **volatility** of financial time series data. GARCH models are particularly effective in capturing **time-varying volatility**.

### **GARCH Model Overview**

The **GARCH(p, q)** model assumes that the conditional variance of returns at time \( t \), \( \sigma_t^2 \), is dependent on past **squared returns** and **past volatility**.

The GARCH(1,1) model is the simplest form and is given by:

$$
\sigma_t^2 = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 r_{t-1}^2 + \beta_1 \sigma_{t-1}^2
$$

Where:
- \( \sigma_t^2 \) is the conditional variance at time \( t \)
- \( \alpha_0 \) is the constant term
- \( \alpha_1 \) and \( \beta_1 \) are the parameters of the model
- \( r_{t-1}^2 \) is the squared return at time \( t-1 \)

### **Example: GARCH-based VaR Calculation**

Suppose you estimate volatility using a GARCH(1,1) model and obtain the following values for the parameters:
- \( \alpha_0 = 0.0001 \)
- \( \alpha_1 = 0.1 \)
- \( \beta_1 = 0.85 \)

Using these values, you calculate the conditional variance \( \sigma_t^2 \) and then use it to compute VaR:

$$
\text{VaR} = \text{Portfolio Value} \times \sigma_t \times Z_{\alpha}
$$

- **CVaR** provides a more comprehensive view of risk by calculating the **average loss beyond the VaR threshold**.
- **RiskMetrics** is useful for **short-term volatility forecasting** and **VaR estimation**.
- **GARCH** models are essential for estimating **volatility clustering** and **conditional volatility** over time.

Each of these methods provides unique insights into risk management, and often, financial institutions combine them to get a more accurate picture of the risks in their portfolios.
